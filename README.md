# PROJECT TITLE: HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND ROUTINE CHECKUP ANALYSIS

# 1.	Project Background and Overview
Routine health checkups and health insurance coverage are critical indicators of preventive healthcare. This analysis tracks key metrics such as insurance coverage rates, routine checkup participation, and checkup intervals to identify trends and disparities, aiming to guide public health strategies toward improving access and equity. This analysis examines these aspects to identify trends and disparities, aiming to guide public health strategies toward improving access and equity.
## Dataset Overview:
•	Total Records Analyzed: 6,158 entries.
•	Key Variables: Demographics, socioeconomic status, health insurance coverage, and routine checkup intervals.
## Objectives:
1.	Quantify the proportion of individuals with health insurance and routine checkups.
2.	Analyze routine checkup behavior across demographic and socioeconomic groups.
3.	Identify patterns in the frequency of routine health checkups.

# 2.	Executive Summary
________________________________________
Key Findings
Insurance Coverage:
•	58.8% of individuals are insured; 41.2% are uninsured.
•	Coverage rates increase significantly with employment and income levels.
Routine Checkups:
•	Only 29.1% of individuals undergo routine checkups.
•	Higher participation is observed among older adults (60+ years: 63.3%) and higher-income groups (52.6%).
Checkup Intervals:
•	94.0% do not engage in routine checkups.
•	3.9% report annual checkups, highlighting limited engagement in preventive healthcare.
Implications: The findings emphasize the need for targeted interventions to enhance both insurance coverage and routine checkup participation. Expanding access and increasing awareness will directly impact public health outcomes.

4.	Key Insights
________________________________________
Insight 1: Health Insurance Coverage
•	Data: 58.8% insured; 41.2% uninsured.
•	Metric: Insurance coverage correlates with income and employment status.
•	Observation: Low-income and unemployed groups have significantly lower coverage rates.
•	Recommendation:
o	Introduce employer-sponsored insurance initiatives.
o	Expand public health schemes targeting low-income populations.

Insight 2: Routine Health Checkups
•	Data:
o	29.1% of individuals participate in routine checkups.
o	63.3% participation among older adults (60+ years).
o	52.6% participation among high-income earners.
•	Metric: Higher engagement is observed among older adults and high-income groups.
•	Observation: Younger individuals and low-income groups lack engagement in routine preventive care.
•	Recommendation:
o	Launch awareness campaigns targeting younger populations.
o	Incentivize routine checkups for low-income groups through subsidized healthcare.

Insight 3: Patterns in Checkup Intervals
•	Data:
o	94.0% do not engage in routine checkups.
o	3.9% report annual checkups.
•	Metric: Preventive care engagement remains low across all groups.
•	Observation: Most individuals either do not engage or prefer annual checkups.
•	Recommendation:
o	Promote annual checkups as a standard practice.
o	Collaborate with healthcare providers to offer incentives for regular participation.
